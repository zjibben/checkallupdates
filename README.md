Checkallupdates is a program analogous to Arch Linux's `checkupdates`; it just produces a list of available updates for your Arch system. However, unlike `checkupdates` it includes AUR packages, puts everything in nice tables, separates software upgrades from package upgrades similar to Yaourt, and is significantly slower. It depends on `python-texttable` and `cower`.
