Checkallupdates is a program analogous to Arch Linux's `checkupdates` which takes the output of `pacaur -Qu` and separates the available updates into a software update table and a package-only update table, in an attempt to recreate the only thing I missed after transitioning away from yaourt. It depends on `python-texttable` and `pacaur`.
