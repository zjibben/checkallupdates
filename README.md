Checkallupdates is a program analogous to Arch Linux's `checkupdates`; it just produces a list of available updates for your Arch system. However, unlike `checkupdates` it includes packages from the AUR, puts the updates in nice tables, and separates software upgrades from package upgrades similar to `yaourt`, and is significantly slower. It depends on `python-texttable` and `cower`.
